## 🎮Game Concept
BrainFlip: The Flashcard Game is a console-based quiz where players test their general knowledge across two challenging levels.
The goal is simple: answer questions, keep your lives, and climb the leaderboard.
With shuffled questions, a limited number of hints, and a race against the clock, no two playthroughs feel the same.

## ✨Core Features
- Two Levels of Play
- Level 1: General knowledge with no time limit.
- Level 2: Timed answers + hints for extra challenge.
- Randomized Question Order – Every run feels fresh.
- Lives System – 3 lives per level; lose them all and it’s game over.
- Hints Mechanic – Request up to 2 hints in Level 2 by typing "hint".
- Timer – 10-second countdown per question in Level 2.
- Leaderboard – Saves and displays top scores.
- Simple Console Controls – No complex setup, just type answers and play.
